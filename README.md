# 🔐 KeyLock Project

KeyLock is a robust User, Application, and License management system. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage users and licenses across various applications. 🚀

## 🌟 Features

KeyLock currently supports the following features:

- **Certificate Generation**: Unique certificates for each application. 📜
- **JWT Tokens**: User authentication using JWT tokens. 🔑
- **License Verification**: A secure endpoint for license verification that doesn't expose sensitive data. 🛡️
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: Ensures data integrity and security on mission-critical endpoints. ✅

## 🛠️ Technologies

KeyLock is built with the following technologies:

- **NodeJS & JavaScript**: The core technology stack. (~~Lord Allmighty, save my soul I beg you~~) 🟨
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Used for data storage and schema design. 🟩

## 📦 Installation
Follow these steps to get KeyLock up and running:

1. **MongoDB**: KeyLock requires MongoDB. The installation of MongoDB is not covered in this instruction. Please refer to the official MongoDB documentation for installation guidance. 📚
2. **Environment Variables**: Set the environment variable `MONGODB` to the connection string of your MongoDB instance. This can be a remote instance as well. 🌐
3. **Signature Secret**: Set the environment variable `SIGNATURE_SECRET` to a string of your choice. This will be used for cryptographic operations. 🔐

Now, you can install the necessary dependencies and start the application:

```bash
npm i 
node index.js 
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Here are some features we're planning to add:

- **Heartbeat Websocket**: Real-time connection monitoring. 💓
- **Native Dynamic SDK**: A dynamic library for more flexible integration. 🧩
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to make it easier for users and contributors. 📚
- **Managerial Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for managing users and licenses. 🖥️
